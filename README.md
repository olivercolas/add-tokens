# Add tokens to your Web3 wallet

This simple project lets you search for tokens on your network and add them to your web3 wallet. 

This does not give you free tokens. 

By adding a token to your wallet, you can track its balance without having to connect to a Defi app.

## Where are the token lists coming from?

I'm currently using this [traderjoe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traderjoe-xyz/joe-tokenlists/main/joe.tokenlist.json) list for avalanche 
and this [uniswap](https://wispy-bird-88a7.uniswap.workers.dev/?url=http://tokenlist.aave.eth.link) list for ethereum.

## Why?

At some point I decided to try bridging my assets to Ethereum, I found the process extremely stressful as I wasn't sure what contract address it was bridged to.

I also found myself needing to re-add tokens more often than I thought I would, this tool helps add my favorite tokens quickly and painlessly.
